## About

This app aims to simplify the process of donating to your local foodbank. Utlising user location data or postcode input, upon opening the app the user will be shown a list of their 10 nearest foodbanks with the corresponding locations on a dynamic map. Clicking on an individual foodbank will take the user to a new page, where more detail about the foodbank is provided, as well as a list of the foodbanks specific needs.
